# Setup Amazon Bedrock Agent for Webscraping

## Introduction
This guide details the setup process for an Amazon Bedrock agent on AWS, which will include setting up an S3 bucket, action group, and a Lambda function. We will use an action group that will webscrape a URL passed in from the user prompt.

## Prerequisites
- An active AWS Account.
- Familiarity with AWS services like Amazon Bedrock, S3, and Lambda.

## Configuration and Setup

### Step 1: Creating S3 Buckets
- Please make sure that you are in the **us-west-2** region. 

- **Artifacts & Lambda layer Bucket**: Create another S3 bucket to store artifacts. For example, call it "artifacts-bedrock-agent-creator-alias". You will need to download, then add the API schema file to this S3 bucket. This .json file can be found [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agents-streamlit/blob/main/ActionSchema.json). 

The provided schema is an OpenAPI specification for the "PortfolioCreator API," which outlines the structure and capabilities of a service designed for company portfolio creation, company financial research, and sending an email. This API Schema is a rich description of each action, so agents know when to use it, and exactly how to call it and use results. This schmea defines three primary endpoints, `/companyResearch`, `/createPortfolio`, and `/sendEmail` detailing how to interact with the API, the required parameters, and the expected responses.) Once uploaded, please select and open the .json document to review the content.

### Step 2: Knowledge Base Setup in Bedrock Agent

- Before we setup the knowledge base, we will need to grant access to the models that will be needed for our agent in Bedrock. Navigate to the Amazon Bedrock console, then on the left of the screen, scroll down and select “Model access”. On the right, select the orange “manage model access” button.

![Model access](Streamlit_App/images/model_access.png)

- Select the checkbox next to the “Models” column. This will auto select all of the models. After, scroll down to the bottom right and select “Request model access”. 

![Request model access](Streamlit_App/images/request_model_access.png)

![Request model access btn](Streamlit_App/images/request_model_access_btn.png)

- After, verify that the Access status of the Models is green stating “Access granted”.

![Access granted](Streamlit_App/images/access_granted.png)


- Now, we will create a knowledge base by selecting “Knowledge base” on the left, then selecting the orange button “Create Knowledge base”.  

![create_kb_btn](Streamlit_App/images/create_kb_btn.png)

- You can use the default name, or enter in your own. Then, select "Next" at the bottom right of the screen.

![KB details](Streamlit_App/images/kb_details.png)

![KB details 2](Streamlit_App/images/kb_details_next.png)

- Sync S3 bucket "knowledgebase-bedrock-agent-alias" to this knowledge base.

![KB setup](Streamlit_App/images/KB_setup.png)

- Select the default option OpenSearch Serverless as the vector store.
 
![Vector Store Config](Streamlit_App/images/vector_store_config.png)

- On the next screen, review your work, then select "Create Knowledge Base" 
(Creating the knowledge base may take a few minutes. You can continue to the next step in the meantime.)

![Review and Create KB](Streamlit_App/images/review_create_kb.png)



### Step 3: Lambda Function Configuration
- Create a Lambda function (Python 3.11) for the Bedrock agent's action group. We will call this Lambda function "PortfolioCreator-actions". 

![Create Function](Streamlit_App/images/create_function.png)

![Create Function2](Streamlit_App/images/create_function2.png)

- Copy the provided code from the ["ActionLambda.py"](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agents-streamlit/blob/main/ActionLambda.py) file into your Lambda function. After, select the deploy button in the tab section in the Lambda console. Review the code provided before moving to the next step. (Make sure that the IAM role associated with the Bedrock agent can invoke the Lambda function)

![Lambda deploy](Streamlit_App/images/lambda_deploy.png)

- Next, apply a resource policy to the Lambda to grant Bedrock agent access. To do this, we will switch the top tab from “code” to “configuration” and the side tab to “Permissions”. Then, scroll to the “Resource-based policy statements” section and click the “Add permissions” button.

![Permissions config](Streamlit_App/images/permissions_config.png)

![Lambda resource policy create](Streamlit_App/images/lambda_resource_policy_create.png)

- Here is an example of the resource policy. (At this part of the setup, we will not have a Bedrock agent Source ARN. So, enter in "arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:{accoundID}:agent/BedrockAgentID" for now. We will include the ARN once it’s generated in step 6 after creating the Bedrock Agent alias):

![Lambda resource policy](Streamlit_App/images/lambda_resource_policy.png)


### Step 4: Setup Bedrock Agent and Action Group 
- Navigate to the Bedrock console, go to the toggle on the left, and under “Orchestration” select Agents, then select “Create Agent”.

![Orchestration2](Streamlit_App/images/orchestration2.png)

- On the next screen, provide an agent name, like “PortfolioCreator”. Leave the other options as default, then select “Next”

![Agent details](Streamlit_App/images/agent_details.png)

![Agent details 2](Streamlit_App/images/agent_details_2.png)

- Select the Anthropic: Claude V1.2 model. Now, we need to add instructions by creating a prompt that defines the rules of operation for the agent. In the prompt below, we provide specific direction on how the model should use tools to answer questions. Copy, then paste the details below into the agent instructions. 

"You are an investment banker who creates portfolios of companies based on the number of companies, and industry in the <user-request>. You also research companies, and summarize documents. You send emails that include the last company portfolio created and FOMC summary searched. Format the email like normal. Formulate a solution to a given <user-request> based on the instructions and tools provided."

![Model select2](Streamlit_App/images/select_model.png)

- When creating the agent, select Lambda function "PortfolioCreator-actions". Next, select the schema file ActionSchema.json from the s3 bucket "artifacts-bedrock-agent-creator-alias". Then, select "Next" 

![Add action group](Streamlit_App/images/action_group_add.png)


### Step 5: Setup Knowledge Base with Bedrock Agent

- When integrating the KB with the agent, you will need to provide basic instructions on how to handle the knowledge base. For example, use the following: “Use this knowledge base when a user asks about data, such as economic trends, company financial statements, or the outcomes of the Federal Open Market Committee meetings.”
 
![Knowledge base add2](Streamlit_App/images/add_knowledge_base2.png)

Review, then select the “Create Agent” button.

![create_agent_button](Streamlit_App/images/create_agent_button.png)


### Step 6: Create an alias
-Create an alias (new version), and choose a name of your liking. Make sure to copy and save your Agent ID and Agent Alias ID. You will need these in step 9.
 
![Create alias](Streamlit_App/images/create_alias.png)

- Next, navigate to the "Agent Overview" settings for the agent created by selecting "Agents" under the Orchestration dropdown menu on the left of the screen, then select the agent. Copy the Agent ARN, then add this ARN to the resource policy of Lambda function “PortfolioCreator-actions” previously created in step 3. 

![Agent ARN2](Streamlit_App/images/agent_arn2.png)


## Step 7: Testing the Setup
### Testing the Knowledge Base
- While in the Bedrock console, select “Knowledge base” under the Orchestration tab, then the KB you created. Scroll down to the Data source section, and make sure to select the “Sync” button.

![KB sync](Streamlit_App/images/kb_sync.png)

- You will see a user interface on the right where you will need to select a model. Choose the Anthropic Claude V1.2 model, then select “Apply”.

![Select model test](Streamlit_App/images/select_model_test.png)

- You should now have the ability to enter prompts in the user interface provided.

![KB prompt](Streamlit_App/images/kb_prompt.png)

- Test Prompts:
  1. "Give me a summary of financial market developments and open market operations in January 2023."
  2. "Can you provide information about inflation or rising prices?"
  3. "What can you tell me about the Staff Review of the Economic & Financial Situation?"

### Testing the Bedrock Agent
- While in the Bedrock console, select “Agents” under the Orchestration tab, then the agent you created. You should be able to enter prompts in the user interface provided to test your knowledge base and action groups from the agent.

![Agent test](Streamlit_App/images/agent_test.png)

- Example prompts fot Knowledge Base:
   1. "Give me a summary of financial market developments and open market operations in January 2023"
   2. "Tell me the participants view on economic conditions and economic outlook"
   3. "Provide any important information I should know about inflation, or rising prices"
   4. "Tell me about the Staff Review of the Economic & financial Situation"

- Example prompts for Action Groups:
   1. "Create a portfolio with 3 companies in the real estate industry"
   2. "Create portfolio of 3 companies that are in the technology industry"
   3. "Provide more details on these companies"
   4. "Create a new investment portfolio of companies"
   5. "Do company research on TechStashNova Inc."

- Example prompt for KB & AG
    1. "Send an email to test@example.com that includes the company portfolio and FOMC summary" 
    `(The logic for this method is not implemented to send emails)`  


## Step 8: Setting Up Cloud9 Environment (IDE)

1.	Navigate in the Cloud9 management console. Then, select “Create Environment”

![create_environment](Streamlit_App/images/create_environment.png)

2. Here, you will enter the following values in each field
   - Name: Bedrock-Environment (Enter any name)
   - Instance type: t3.small
   - Platform: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
   - Timeout: 1 hour  

![ce2](Streamlit_App/images/ce2.png)

   - Once complete, select the "Create" button at the bottom of the screen. The environment will take a couple of minutes to spin up. If you get an error spinning up Cloud9 due to lack of resources, you can also choose t2.micro for the instance type and try again. (The Cloud9 environment has Python 3.10.12 version at the time of this publication)


![ce3](Streamlit_App/images/ce3.png)

3. Navigate back to the Cloud9 Environment, then select "open" next to the Cloud9 you just created. Now, you are ready to setup the Streamlit app!

![environment](Streamlit_App/images/environment.png)


## Step 9: Setting Up and Running the Streamlit App
1. **Obtain the Streamlit App ZIP File**: Download the zip file of the project [here](https://github.com/build-on-aws/bedrock-agents-streamlit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

2. **Upload to Cloud9**:
   - In your Cloud9 environment, upload the ZIP file.

![Upload file to Cloud9](Streamlit_App/images/upload_file_cloud9.png)

3. **Unzip the File**:
   - Use the command `unzip bedrock-agents-streamlit-main.zip` to extract the contents.
4. **Navigate to Streamlit_App Folder**:
   - Change to the directory containing the Streamlit app. Use the command `cd ~/environment/bedrock-agents-streamlit-main/Streamlit_App`
5. **Update Configuration**:
   - Open the `InvokeAgent.py` file.
   - Update the `agentId` and `agentAliasId` variables with the appropriate values, then save it.

![Update Agent ID and alias](Streamlit_App/images/update_agentId_and_alias.png)

6. **Install Streamlit** (if not already installed):
   - Run `pip install streamlit`. Additionally, make sure boto3, and pandas dependencies are installed by running `pip install boto3` and `pip install pandas`.

7. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   - Execute the command `streamlit run app.py --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.port=8080`.
   - Streamlit will start the app, and you can view it by selecting "Preview" within the Cloud9 IDE at the top, then "Preview Running Application"
   - Once the app is running, please test some of the sample prompts provided. (On 1st try, if you receive an error, try again.)
